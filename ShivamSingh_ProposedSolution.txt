Problem statement: The task is to develop a software solution that can automatically count the number of polyps in colonoscopy videos. This involves image processing, computer vision, and machine learning techniques.

Proposed workflow:

1. Data extraction and preprocessing
	a. Frame extraction: Extact image frames from the input video sequence
	b. Image enhacement : Gaussian blur, morphological operations such as contrast enhancement, noise reduction, and possibly color normalization. 
	c. Find ROI
	d. Exclude visually redunant information in frames

2. Conventionl OpenCV operations

3. Deep Learning (CNN)
	A. Model selection:
		a. Semantic Segmentation: U-Net, DUCK-Net
		b. Object detection: Faster-RCNN, YOLO,etc with Non-Max Suppresion and higher threshold
		c. Instance segmentataion: Mask RCNN, Segment Anything Model(SAM)
	B. Training:
		a. Fine-tune a pretrained model specifically trained on colonoscopy data, best if pretrained for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis detection	
		b. Data augmentataion: Flipping, rotataions
	C. Evaluation:
		a. mean IoU, Dice Score
		b. Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-score, mAP
	C. Inference (Total count of polyps):
		a. For detection: count number of bound boxes
		b. For Segmentation: Using connected component analysis to identify connected regions (blobs) in the segmented image
		
6. Post processing correction:
	a. Object tracking
	b. Total Count without repetition
	c. Define disease category/severity based on "count" thresholds/range


7. Challenges:
	a. Data:
		i. Polys vary in size, color, texture, etc. Using pretrained model specificially fine-tuned/trained colonoscopy datasets like:
			CVC-ClinicDB : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/cvcclinicdb 
			SUN-SEG: http://amed8k.sundatabase.org/
			GLRC & CVC colon DB: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/citation?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/FCBUOR
		ii. Artifacts: 
			fluids, reflections, blurring


8. Future work
	
	A. Labelled data for trainig
	B. Modeling: Real time detection & tracking: 
		YOLOv5, v7, v8 or RetinaNet,
		Progressively Normalized Self-Attention Network for Video Polyp Segmentation: https://github.com/GewelsJI/VPS
	
	C. Overlapping Polyps: 
		i. Use instace segmentataion instead of object detection
		ii. Connected Component Analysis, watershed segmentation to distinguish clustered polyps
		
	D. State-of-the-art

Conclusion:
The FastRCNN model is successfully integrated with the UI, however as seen the "Total polyp count=0" and the model detect the entire object in the image as the target and not just the polyps. Therefore, my next steps will to fine tune a pretrained model (specific on colonoscopy data) and a large colonscopy dataset and use these two test videos for inferecing only.
The OpencCV morphological operations fails to identify polyps due to limited variation amongst poly and data.
